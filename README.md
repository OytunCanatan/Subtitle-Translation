# NLP Project Proposal
# Subtitle Translation

Usage of internet which is common communication and access tool increased nowadays. we can't ignore the usage.
At the same time people can not watch all foreign movie and series which in on vision on people's own language.So people's large part watch old and new movie and series on the internet.That's so common our country.
On the other our usage of internet is not improved as much as our level of foreign language.Because of that's reason most of people watch that movie and series with turkish subtitle.
My program helps people that's situation and that's subtitle will be most closely on our language.I will use google translate and windows bing bar translate for translation.

There is some example on my program.
